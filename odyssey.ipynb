    "   - Merge the datasets - Delta, Oscar, Tango, and Yankee into one final restaurant dataset.\n",
    "   - Use the *Lookup Records* table for reference on joining the source tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Details**:\n",
    "   - Datasets contain unique details (e.g., Dining Style, Meals Offered).\n",
    "   - Some details (e.g., Name, Location) are shared across datasets.\n",
    "   - Your goal: Merge to create `Table Z`.\n",

    "3. **How to Merge**:\n",
    "   - Join tables Delta through Yankee using **all columns**.\n",
    "   - Address overlapping columns to avoid duplication.\n",
    "   - Merge columns with similar data but different names (like 'telephone_number' and 'phone_number').\n",

    "> 📝 It's important to note that while this example is straightforward, you may encounter some ambiguity when working with the actual datasets Delta through Yankee. **The main objective is to construct a dataset that provides a comprehensive and detailed context for each restaurant**. There will be instances where you'll need to make subjective decisions, such as prioritizing one dataset over another or creating a new field to harmonize different representations of the same data across datasets (e.g., your own classification of price range). These decisions are up to you, and we encourage you to develop your own approach and rationale for resolving these issues. Just make sure to explain your choices and reasoning in a markdown cell.\n",

    "### Tips 💡 \n",
    "- Remember to clean up columns in the 4 source datasets where necessary that would make the join more seamless, instead of retrofitting ad-hoc fixes after the fact.\n",
    "- If you have two or more columns with same or similar names or two or more different columns that are representing the same kind of data - then you have not reached the final output\n",
    "- All values in a single column should have the same data type. A type can be simple like `integer`, `float`, `string`, or complex like `list[str]` or `list[int]`. Try to avoid columns that result in having `json` or `dict` values.\n",
    "- The underlying four datasets and lookup records may have duplicates, so watch out for bugs in the join"
